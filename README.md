This quark contains PmodEnv, a litte pattern that allow you to modulate any Pbind key with a long lasting envelope generated by a pattern

```
Pbind(\instrument, saw, \cutoff, PmodEnv(Pseq([1/2,2,1,4],1), 2) ),
```

In this quark there is also:
* PnoteEnv: The modulating Env is unique to each event note
* PpatEnv: Generate a static Env from a pattern, for synthdef that take an Env as argument
